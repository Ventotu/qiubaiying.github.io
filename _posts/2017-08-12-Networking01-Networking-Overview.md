## Networking: Mindset & Key Strategies
Don’t talk about pro questions like:
* Bullet Where do you think the market is heading?
* What do you think is going on with this company?
* What you think about the future the industry?

Because recuriters have heard a lot about these. You can talk about other things: Ski trips, your hobbies, your study abroad experience, your trip to Spain, even recent events in the person’s life, whether it is their recent wedding or vacation or something like that;

## Three ways to network
### 1. Setting up informational interviews

Contacting alumni or school, going through your professional network, going through friends and family, going through other people that you have some connection to, and setting up informational interviews, developing a relationship with them, and then when the time is right, going in and asking for something specific, whether it is a referral, asking how you can position yourself for an interview, or something else along those lines.

### 2. Cold calling.

This is actually simpler, in many ways, than establishing relationships, because you have a very set purpose and it is not too complicated. It is more about persistence and following-up than it is about figuring out your story, asking the right questions, and getting people to like you, necessarily. Cold calling can work very well, especially for internships, and also for smaller firms, anyone local, as well.

### 3. Co-worker networking

With co-worker networking, there is really a lot of overlap with informational interviews. The main difference is that you do not have to be quite as formal because you some connection to the people already, so you can be a bit more direct with what you say. One difference though, is that you do have to take more care, you to be more cautious about what you say, and to whom you say it, because there is always a risk that rumors could start going around. People could figure out that you are looking for other opportunities.
